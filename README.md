# Brain_MRI_Detection_using_CNN-and-Yolov8
This project is about Brain MRI detection, combining CNNs for feature extraction and YOLOv8 for real-time detection of abnormalities in MRI scans. It enables fast, accurate identification of brain conditions like tumors, enhancing early diagnosis and supporting advanced medical decision-making.
